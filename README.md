# data_vis


### overview
This builds a full visualization pipeline that requires data to be served
dynamically based on user interactions on the front-end. Here I reproduce a visualization with a
user interface that allows users to enter a zip code, and then show the distribution of cuisine within that zip
code. 

### data
* [nyc_restaurants_by_cuisine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hvo/datasets/master/nyc_restaurants_by_cuisine.json)

### NYU CUSP
